    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p><strong>Heat Sink Analysis of Transformerless Inverters with Boost Converter for Solar PV Power Generation using MATLAB</strong><br>
      - Conducted a MATLAB simulation of a boost converter circuit and analyzed its performance under different input and output conditions.<br>
      - Calculated the optimal values of the inductor and capacitor for the boost converter based on the desired voltage gain and ripple factor.<br>
      - Designed an inverter circuit with a single-phase full-bridge topology and implemented a sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) technique to control the output voltage and frequency.<br>
      - Evaluated the thermal properties of inverter components and chose an appropriate heat sink to dissipate excess heat, ensuring a safe operating temperature is maintained.
    </p>
    <p><strong>MATLAB-Based Simulation of PI Control for Brushless DC Motor Regulation-Team of 3</strong><br>
        - Conducted in-depth analysis of multiple control cases for Brushless DC (BLDC) motor speed regulation using a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller.<br>

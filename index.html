<p><strong>Voice-Controlled Machine Start/Stop (Voice-MQTT-Control)</strong><br>
  - Developed a real-time voice interface to control machine operations via MQTT.<br>
  - Continuously listens for commands like "hello start" or "hello stop", and publishes corresponding control signals to the PLC.<br>
  üéôÔ∏è Voice to command conversion using speech_recognition<br>
  üì° Sends MQTT signal: "ALLOW_START = True" to topic plc/voice_control<br>
  üß† Supports integration with any PLC/HMI that listens on MQTT<br>
  Use Case: Enables hands-free operation of packaging or assembly lines for improved ergonomics and safety.<br>
  üîó <a href="https://youtu.be/edpH9dS-Fis" target="_blank">Demo Video</a><br>
